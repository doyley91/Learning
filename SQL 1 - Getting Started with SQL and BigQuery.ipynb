It is an important skill for any data scientist or aspiring data scientist.\n\n[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) is a Google Cloud tool for working with **very** large databases. You can interact with data in BigQuery using SQL.\n\nThis series of tutorials and hands-on exercises will teach all the components you need to become effective with SQL and BigQuery.\n\n---\n\n# Using BigQuery From Kaggle\n\nThis section describes basics for using BigQuery in Kaggle notebooks this includes:\n\n* Getting your notebook set up\n* Checking the structure of the dataset (to help you when you want to write queries)\n* Checking the size of a query before you run it (to avoid accidentally asking for way more data than you wanted)\n* Running your first query\n\nIntricacies of SQL will come in subsequent steps.\n\n---\n\n## Set-Up\n\nThe first step is to start a kernel using one of the BigQuery datasets as the data source. You can find these datasets by going to the [Datasets page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and selecting \"BigQuery\" from the \"File Types\" drop down menu. (Or use [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?filetype=bigQuery).) \n\nSelect a BigQuery dataset from that list, go to the dataset page for it and start a new kernel on it by hitting the \"New Kernel\" button. Right now, you can only use BigQuery databases with Python kernels.\n\nIn order to make your life easier, we'll use a Python package called `bq_helper`. It has helper functions for putting BigQuery results in Pandas DataFrames. \n\nYou can use `bq_helper` in your kernel by importing it with the command"

      "source": "After adding a BigQuery package to our kernel and importing the helper package, create a BigQueryHelper object pointing to a specific dataset. \n\nFind what the dataset is called by checking out the dataset listing for your dataset and then navigating to the \"Data\" tab. For example, [here's a link to the Data tab of the Hacker News dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news/data), which is what we'll use in this example.\n\nIf you go to the link I provided, you'll notice a blue rectangle with rounded edges near the top of the page that has the following text in it: \"bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.comments\". This tells you that you're looking of a summary of the \"comments\" table in the \"hacker_news\" dataset. The addresses of BigQuery datasets look like this:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/l11gdKx.png)\n\nWe will need to pass this information to BigQueryHelper in order to create our helper object. The active_project argument takes the BigQuery info, which is currently \"bigquery-public-data\" for all the BigQuery datasets on Kaggle. The dataset_name argument takes the name of the dataset we've added to our query. In this case it's \"hacker_news\". So we can create our BigQueryHelper object like so:"

Remember that you can scan 5TB every 30 days for free, and after that you'll need to wait until the end of that 30-day period.\n\nThe [biggest dataset currently on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/github/github-repos) is 3 terabytes, so you can easily go past your 30-day quota by running just a couple of queries!\n\n> **What's a query?** A query is small piece of SQL code that specifies what data would you like to scan from a databases, and how much of that data you would like returned. (Note that your quota is on data *scanned*, not the amount of data returned.)\n\nOne way to help avoid this is to estimate how big your query will be before you actually execute it. You can do this with the `BigQueryHelper.estimate_query_size()` method. For the rest of this notebook, I'll be using an example query that finding the scores for every Hacker News post of the type \"job\". Let's see how much data it will scan if we actually ran it."

      "source": "# Avoiding Common Mistakes when Querying Big Datasets\n____\n\nBig data is great! But working at a bigger scale makes your problems bigger too, like [this professor whose experiment racked up an unexpected $1000 bill](https://www.wired.com/2012/04/aws-bill-in-minutes/). Kaggle isn't charging for accessing BigQuery datasets, but these best practices can help you avoid trouble down the line.\n\n* *Avoid using the asterisk *(**) in your queries.* The asterisk means “everything”. This may be okay with smaller datasets, but getting everything from a 4 terabyte dataset takes a long time and eats into your monthly usage limit.\n* *For initial exploration, look at just part of the table instead of the whole thing.* If you're just curious to see what data's in a table, preview it instead of scanning the whole table. The `BigQueryHelper.head()` method in our helper package does this. Like `head()` in Pandas or R, it returns just the first few rows for you to look at.\n* *Double-check the size of complex queries.* If you're planning on running what might be a large query, either estimate the size first or run it using the `BigQueryHelper.query_to_pandas_safe()` method.\n* *Be cautious about joining tables.* In particular, avoid joining a table with itself (i.e. a self-join) and try to avoid joins that return a table that's larger than the ones you're joining together. (You can double-check yourself by joining just the heads of the tables.)\n* *Don't rely on LIMIT*: One of the things that can be confusing when working with BigQuery datasets is the difference between the data you *scan* and the data you actually *get back* especially since it's the first one that actually counts against your quota. When you do something like select a column with LIMIT = 10, you'll only get 10 results back, but you'll scan the whole column (and that counts against your monthly usage limit)."
